# Craters-and-Boulders
The Crater and Boulder Detection System leverages advanced deep learning algorithms, specifically YOLOv8, to automate the detection and classification of craters and boulders on planetary surfaces. This innovative system is designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of geological analysis in planetary exploration by processing large volumes of imagery from space missions. Through a modular architecture, it seamlessly integrates image preprocessing, real-time detection, and result visualization, making it a valuable tool for scientists and engineers. The system not only reduces the reliance on manual analysis but also improves decision-making in mission-critical scenarios. Its adaptability for various planetary environments positions it as a critical resource for future space exploration efforts, facilitating deeper insights into planetary geology.
